# turtle

A Turtle loading module for CRG. This has a long way to go. Eventually it will be:
- 100% Clojure (except for code generated by Beaver and JFlex).
- Pull based. Currently it is event based.
- Implements ISeq lazily.

## Installation

Not yet applicable.

## Usage

Right now this is stubbed out to parse into Clojure, but no tests are built.

    $ lein run file.ttl

## Examples

    $ lein run simple.ttl

### Bugs

Probably lots, but since the system has so many changes to make then it doesn't matter too much yet.
